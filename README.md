ATF1502-EVB
===========

*ATF1502-EVB* is a simple and low-cost evaluation board for the [Microchip ATF1502AS](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATF1502AS) CPLD. It may also be used with ATF1504AS in the TQFP-44 package. It breaks out every I/O pin on a DIP-style package, exposes JTAG on a 6-pin connector, and optionally (with a solder jumper) allows two LEDs to be connected to pins 22 and 23 of the CPLD.

[PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) has sponsored a prototype batch of these boards. (Thanks!)
